            <p>It is no secret that women's rights are currently
                at stake in America with the overturning of Roe v. Wade. Though much progress has been made for women's rights in the past century, the threat to reproductive rights,
                same-sex marriage, and to transgender healthcare are all too real. These policies disproportionately harm people of marginalized
                class, race, and gender identities.
                <br><br>
                With ever rising rates of <a href="https://www.hrc.org/resources/fatal-violence-against-the-transgender-and-gender-non-conforming-community-in-2021" target="_blank">hate crimes,</a> homelessness, and poverty in these communities - it is clear that more than ever, 
                changes need to be made to the systems that dictate this injustice. No one should have to leave their house with the 
                fear of violence lingering in the back of their minds - but this is the reality for many people.
